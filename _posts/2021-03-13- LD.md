# Terms

|   | Linkage Equillibrium      | Linkage Dysequillibrum        |
|---|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
|   | Two locus are independent | Two locus are not independent |
|   | Extensive recombination   | Some or no recombination      |
|   | \|D\| = 0                 | \|D\|>0                       |

# Measure Linkage Dysequillibirum by D
Suppose there are two loci, A and B. Both have 2 alleles. Denoted as 0 or 1.

If there's intensive recombination happening between A and B. Getting 1 in A does not imply anything about the genotype is locus B.

Therefore we expect $P_{00} = P_{0\star} \times P_{\star0}$.

$D$ measures the discrepency between real data $P_{00}$ and what we expect under independence $P(0\star) \times P(\star0)$

$D = P_{00} - P(0\star) \times P(\star0)$

> *When Linkage Equillibrium (intensive recombine leads to independence between two loci), D = 0*.

There are many equal ways of expressing D:

$P_{00} = P_{0\star} - P_{01}$

$P_{\star0} = 1-P_{\star1}$

plug the above two into $D = P_{00} - P(0\star) \times P(\star0)$

$D = (P_{0\star} - P_{01}) - P_{0\star}(1-P_{\star1}) = - (P_{01} - P_{0\star} \times P_{\star1})$

Using similar tricks we can get

$D = P_{11} - P(1\star) \times P(\star1)$

# D prime

$D^{\prime} = \frac{|D|}{D_{max}}$ 

is just to make the measure always between 0 and 1

# Linkage Dysequillibrium (LD) Decay: How does D change over time?

Denote $D^{(t)}$ as $D$ at time $t$. $P_{00}^{(t)}$ as probability of observing 0 in both loci at time $t$.

At time $t = 0$, mutations are created.

Recombination rate $c$ means number of crossover per b.p. per generation.

When two loci are $L$ b.p. apart, we can expect $Lc$ crossovers.

Let's establish the relationship between $D^{(t)}$ and $D^{(t-1)}$:

The original D formula: $D^{(t)} = P_{00}^{(t)} - P_{0\star}^{(t)} P_{\star0}^{(t)}$

1. As Hardy Weinberg Eqilliburm specifies, allele frequency don't change over time. Thus $P_{0\star}^{(t)} = P_{0\star}^{(t-1)}$. So does $P_{\star0}^{(t)} = P_{\star0}^{(t-1)}$.

2. Two possibility of resulting in 00 at time $t$:
    - No crossover happens between the two loci, the probability is $1-Lc$. In this case, 00 are preserved. 
    - Crossover occur with probability $Lc$. In this case 00 comes from recombination of 0* and *0.
    - This leads us to $P_{00}^{(t)} = (1-Lc)P_{00}^{(t-1)} + (Lc)(P_{0\star}^{(t-1)} P_{\star0}^{(t-1)})$

Pluggin both back to the original formula:


 $D^{(t)} = P_{00}^{(t)} - P_{0\star}^{(t)} P_{\star0}^{(t)}$

 $= (1-Lc)P_{00}^{(t-1)} + (Lc)(P_{0\star}^{(t-1)} P_{\star0}^{(t-1)}) - P_{0\star}^{(t-1)} P_{\star0}^{(t-1)}$

 $=(1-Lc)D^{(t-1)}$

 More recombination ($Lc$), $D$ drops more per generation and with distance.

Compare to time $t=0$:

$D^{(t)} = (1-Lc)^{t}D^{0}$

When $x$ is small, $(1-x)^{k} \approx \exp{-xk} \approx 1-xk$

Therefore, $D^{(t)} = \exp{-Lct}D^{0}$

> D decays exponentially witg time $t$ and distance $L$.

# r measure: Discrepency to independence

Assuming from linkae equillibirum (independence between loci):

In a population of size $N$

Expected genotype counts(E):

|   |            0                  | 1  |
|---|------------------------------|---|
| 0 |   $N P_{0\star} P_{\star 0}$ | $N P_{0\star} P_{\star 1}$ |
| 1 |   $N P_{1\star} P_{\star 0}$ | $N P_{1\star} P_{\star 1}$ |


Observed genotype counts(O):

|   |            0                  | 1  |
|---|------------------------------|---|
| 0 |   $N P_{00}$ | $N P_{01}$ |
| 1 |   $N P_{10}$ | $N P_{11}$ |

Test statistics:

$r^{2} = \sum \frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}$

# Application

Given 2 SNP matrix, 1 from Africa, 1 from Europe, but we don't know which belongs to which population.
How can you distinguish which matrix belongs to which?

Plot $D$ with respect to $L$.
At the same distance $L$, African population will have lower D (more independent) since they have been recombining for a longer amount of time.
