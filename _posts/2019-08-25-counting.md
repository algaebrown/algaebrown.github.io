# Experiment 1: How many people are there is the class room

# Product rule
Ex: Mayan calender has Tones and 20 Solar signs. How many days are there in a year?

Ans: 13 * 20 = 260


formally, For any sets, A and B:
$ |A \times B|=|A||B|$ (Rosen p.386)

Ex: Kin = 1 day, Uinal = 20 kin, Tun = 18 Uinal, Katun = 20 Tun, Batun = 20 Katun. How many days are there in one Baktun?

Ans = 20 * 20 * 18 * 20

1 Baktun = 20 Katun = 20 * (20 Tun) = 20 * 20 (18 Uinal) = 20 * 20 * 18 * (20 kin )

Ex: Today is 13 Kin, 6 Uinal, 6 Tun, 0 Katun, 13 Baktun. How many days since the Mythical maya creation day?

Ans: ~ 3100 B.C.

13 Baktun = 13 * (20 * 20 * 18 * 20) Kin
6 Tun = 6 * (18 * 20) Kin
13 Kin
Just sum them up

# Sum rule

Ex: Another calender has 20 names symbols and 19 month symbols. How many symbols are there?

Ans = 20 + 19

Formally,

For any **disjoint** set $A$ and $B$:

$ |A+B| =  |A| + |B|$

$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$

# Speed up counting

To speed up counting, break a big group into **disjoint** sets, count them seperately. (That's what they do in the experiment)

# More practice

Ex: Making your own game avatar, there are 8 hair styles and 8 hair colors. How many possible styles are there?

Ans = 8 * 8

Ex: Other than 96 possible custom Miis, a player can choose one of 10 preset characters.

Ans = 96 + 10



# Technique to count things

## Count smaller subsets

Ex: A binary string of length string n. How many possible binary strings $BS(n)$?

Ans: 2 ^ n

1. Count by small subset!
$BS(0)=1$
$BS(1)=2$
$BS(2)=4$
2. Now you find the pattern.
3. Prove the pattern

## Product rule

Now we have n sets.

We are actually doing:

$ {0,1} \times {0,1} \times $ for $n$ times.

Therefore we have $|{0,1}| = 2$

## Sum rule

Split into disjoint subset. 1 subset starts with 0 and the other 1.
Then select the second bit, the third..... until...

$B(n) = B(n-1) + B(n-1) = 2 \times B(n-1)$
$B(0) = 1$

Here we have the recursion. Do the induction!

# More Exercise

Ex: We have 3 different ice-cream cones and 20 different flavors. How many kinds of ice-cream can we make?

Ans: Product rule = 3 * 20

Ex: Now we have complicated ice-cream shop. Instead of just having a single scoop, People can choose to covert them into a sundae with 1 of two different sauce, and whipped cream and cherries are options. How many kinds of possible desserts?

Ans: 3*20 + 3*20*2*2*2

Ex: There are 5 vowels and 21 consonants in English. How do I build a 4-letter word with 1 vowel and 3 consonants?

Ans: $4 * 21 ^ 3 * 5$

# When sum rule fails: Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

for 2 sets:

$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $

for three sets:

$ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - 
(|A \cap B | + | B \cap C| + |C \cap A|) 
+ |A \cap B \cap C| $

for $n$ sets:

Ex: How many length n bit strings are there that start with 1 or end with 00?

Ans:
- start with 1: $ 2^{n-1} $
- ends with 00: $ 2^{n-2} $
- both happens: $ 2^{n-3} $
- finally, $ 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} - 2^{n-3} $

Ex: How many 6-digit strings
1. begin with an even number OR
2. end in 0 OR
3. only onsist of digits less than 5?

Ans:
1. $ 5 * 10^5 $
2. $ 10^5 $
3. $ 5^6 $
1 AND 2: $ 5 * 10 ^4 $
2 AND 3: $ 5^5 $
3 AND 1: $ 3 * 5^5 $
1 AND 2 AND 3: $3 * 5^4 $

Ex: How many 4-digit strings have at least one 0?
Ans:

All 4-digits: $10^4$
All 4-digits w/o 0: $9^4$
Finally, $10^4 - 9^4$

**Why $4*10^3$ is not correct?**

Ex: How many 4-digit string have at least two consecutive digitis that are the same?
all 4 digits: $10^4$
all 4 digits with no same neighbors = $10 * 9^3$

# Permutation: ordering of n **distinct** objects

$ n! = n * (n-1)....1 $

# r-Permutations(nPr): arrange r objects out of n **distinct** objects and **order** it

$P(n,r) = n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-r+1) = n!/(n-r)!$

Think of it as:
 _ _ _ _ _ _having $r$ spots, $n$ different choices.
 for spot 1, we can choose from $n$ choices
 for spot 2, we can choose from $n-1$
 ...
 all the way to spot r, we can choose from $n-r+1$ 

Or, we order all $n$ of them, there are $n!$ permutations.
But now the spots after $r$ is not important at all => need to remove these difference. These difference are $(n-r)!$

Ex: n different marbles, number of ways to order the top 5 marbles.

Ans: $P(n,5) = n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)$

Ex: Planning a trip to 7 different cities, how many ways the trip can be arranged with each city visited only once?

Ans: $7!$

Ex: if I only have money for 5 cities. 

Ans: $P(7,5) = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4* 3$

Ex: what if I must start in New York and end in Seattle? (only have money for 5 cities)

Ans:

New York, _, _ , _, Seattle.
We can only choose 3 out of 5 and order them.
$P(5,3) = 5*4*3$

Ex: what if we must start in New York, and must end in Seattle. Plus must visit LA after SD? (visit all 7 cities, now I am rich)

Ans:
New York, _, _, _, _, _, Seattle.
But LA must go with SD --> NY, _,_,_,__,Seattle.
$4!$

## The travelling salesperson problem with distance matrix

Now we have a matrix of of distances between cities. How to we minimize the distance traveled?

1. Exhaust all $7!$ ways: take so much time!
CSE101 has a better solution

## Back to ice-cream again

Ex: n differen flavors. Make a 2-scoop icecream in which the two scoop must be of different flavor. (**the order DOES matter**)

Ans:
_, _ for 2 scoops.
$P(n,2) = (n)(n-1)$

# Object symmetries

Ex: **What it the order doesn't matter any more**?

Ans: $n(n-1)/2$ becuase for 2 different flavors, there are $2$possible orders (you count twice).

Ex: we have three sticks, red, orange and yellow. How many ways we can use them to create a triangle?

Ans: 
$3!$ is not correct because red-orange-yellow is the same as yellow-red-orange (rotate the triangle)

red-orange-yellow is the same as red-yellow-orange (flip the triangle)

only $1$ ways.

where does that come from?
No. of theoretical object = $3!$
No. of symmetry = # of transformation = (3 rotate)(2 flips) = 6

finally, $3!/{3*2}$

Ex: Now we have 4 sticks of different colors, how many squares can we make?

Ans:
No. of theoretical objects: $4!$
No. of symmetry = (4 rotate)(2 flips)

Finally, $4!/{4*2} = 3$

Ex: How many different arrangements with a 3*3*3 rubik's cube?

Ans:
There are $27$ cublets. But you can't rearrange the cubes like that.
There are $8$ corners(3 colors), $12$ edges(2 colors), $6$ center(they don't move). (and $1$ in the middle that doesn't matter).
Corners always stays in the corner: $8!$ with $3^8$ color arrangements
edge always stays in the edge: $12!$ with $2^12$ color arrangements.

But not all of these are achievable. Need **Group theory**.
There are $12$ orbits (symmetries).
???? I don't understand ????

# Subsets
select k from n **distinct** objects. **orders don't matter**.

Orders don't matter --> a kind of symmetry.

Ex: select a subset of k from n distinct objects.

_,_,..._,_ with k spots. n choices.
select and order = $P(n,k) = (n)(n-1)....(n-k+1)$
No. of symmetry = ordering of k objects = $k!$

Finally, ${P(n,k)}/{k!}$

Formally:

## r-combination
r elements from a set of n **distinct** subject to form an **unordered** subset. n choose r.

$C(n,r) = {P(n,r)}/{r!} = {n!}/{(n-r)!(r!)}$

Ex: Picking 7 students from a class of 150 to go on to a field trip.

Ans: 
$C(150,7) = {150!}/{7!*(150-7)!}$

## r-combination and r-permutation are friends

$ P(n,k) = C(n,k) * (k!)$

You first select $C(n,k)$ and then order $k!$

### The relation between subset and binary strings.

k element subset from n <--> binary string of length n with exactly k ones.

How?

It's like "choose k spots from n and fill it with 1. The rest are 0"
No matter the order you choose.

Or, look it like this: (Bijection)
{1,2} <--> 1100
{1,3} <--> 1010

# Binomial coefficient identities

identity = an equation that is always true.

To prove:
1. Do algebraic manipulations of formulas
2. **Interpret each side as counting some collection of fixed density strings and then prove a statement about those sets.**

Ex: Prove $C(n,k) = C(n,n-k)$

1. Use formula:
$C(n,k) = {n!}/{n!(n-k)!} = C(n, n-k)$

2. Combinatorial proof:

LHS(left hand side counts the binary string of length n with k ones)
RHS counts the binary string with length n with n-k ones.

**make a Bijection**
RHS also counts length n with n-k **zeros**. which is just like length n with k ones, which is LHS.
We can match up all combinations between two sets and thus the two sets are of same **size** BINGO.

** if we think of choosing k out of n:**

- it equal to choosing n-k **to be left out**

Ex: Pascal's identity.
Prove: $C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n,k)$

Ans:

Here we see summation --> split into **disjoint** sets.

LHS = string of length n+1 with k zeros.

= (if the string starts with 0) + (if the string starts with 1)

= (the rest of k-1 zero in length n) + (the k zero in length n)

= $C(n,k-1) + C(n, k)$

= RHS

** Pascal Triangle can solve binomial coefficient. **

### Find a pattern of sum of rows = $2^n$. Why?

All possible strings of length n = 

(with no zero) + (with 1 zero) + ...(with k zero) ... + (with n zero)

= $C(n,0) + C(n,1) ... C(n,k)...+C(n,n)$

= 0 or 1 in each spot

= $2*2*2....for n times = 2^n$

### Fabonacci in Pascal

# Why are they called binomial coefficients?

$(x+y)^n 
= (x+y)(x+y) ...(x+y)
= a{x^n} + b{x^{n-1}y}....z(y^n)$

- it's like choosing either $x$ or $y$ in each ()
- the choosing makes up the coefficient $a,b,...z$.

For example,
- to get $x^n$ you need to all choose n x--> $C(n,1)$ ways to do that.
- to get $x^{n-k}y^{k} you need to choose k y --> $C(n,k) ways to do that --> this is the coefficient.

## Another way to prove $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n C(n,k) = 2^n$

From binomial theorem we know:
$ (x+y)^n = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n C(n,l){x^n}{y^(n-k)}$

let's make $x = 1$ and $y = 1$.

proved.

## To prove $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n C(n,k){(-1)^k} = 0$

make $x = 1, y = -1$
