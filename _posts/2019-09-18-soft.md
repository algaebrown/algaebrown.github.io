# Goals
- bug-free
- useful
- modular
- maintainable
- secure

# Documentation
- python API
- github README
- bash script use `--help` or `-h` flag
- R is different from other language. Slow.

## Document your own code
- docstring. Format by google python style path
    - a sentence
	- args: types
	- return types
	- raise
- Can automatically generate documentation using Sphinx
- commit it after you document it. Do it NOW.
- comments that are not obvious.
- if you need a comment can you code it in a cleaner way? Readibility better than elegance

# Test and Debug
- tests are rarely comprehensive.
- solve a simpler problem you know the answer.
- break into subproblems.

## Code is a stack
- read the stacktrace when the bug is wrong: it prints out the errors in all level.

## test-driven developement
- write test before the function
- pyTest
- raise
- assert 

# software architecture
- single point of entry
- one function do one thing (verb)
- one class for one entity (noun), one class in one document.
- entity: relation between function and classes
- inheritance
- composition: has a relationship

#  Environment
- start a new envirnment for your new project
- conda [env](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html)

## docker
- hardcore conda environment
- developer's snapshot of their working environment. We can just install their image.
- taking more memory.
- pull and run it.

## virtual machine
- an older way of dockering.
