# People are obsessed with "long range information (tens of thousands of b.p.)", why is that?

The purpose of long reads, linked reads and optical mapping are to get information across large regions of DNA? Why is this information important? Here are the reasons:

- **The genome has a lot of repetitive regions.** And short reads coming from those repeats all look very similar. Therefore it is hard to put back where exactly these short reads are from. If we can have longer reads that crosses the repetitive region, then it will be much easier.
- **The genome has many large variation: Structural Variation.** Large pieces (thousands of b.p.) of DNA might be inverted, duplicated, or simply having different number of copies. With short reads, although we might get reads crossing breakpoints, or have more reads aligning to the duplicated regions, these methods have limited sensitivity. Long range information seems to be a more direct way to detect these.
- **Haplotype phasing**: The human genome is diploid, meaning we have two copies of DNA that are *almost* the same. Say we have 2 positions, 5000 b.p. apart that are different, one being AT, the other being CG. To figure out which variants are on the same DNA is called haplotype phasing. Short reads will not be able to tell whether A and C or A and G is on the same copy of DNA.
