# Math concept: Primitive data structure
1. str
2. int, long, short
3. float, double
4. boolean
5. None

# Data Structure
1. List:
    - list
	- for loop
2. Dictionary
    - looking for a value's key will take forever
3. iterator, generators
    - lists you can only access the next item
	- to save memory
	- `range`, `map` return iterator
4. set
    - unordered
	- unique elements
5. tuples
    - lists that cannot be modified.
	- when to use tuples
6. arrays and tensors
    - 2D list, 3D lists
	- `numpy.array`
	- `tf.zeros` a tensor: 3D, 4D array
	- gateway to `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `keras`
7. graphs
    - nodes
	- edges
	- tree: to help sort and search
	    - must be connected
8. relational table
    - `pandas`
	- learn SQL
	- entity = row
	- property = column
	
# Programming
1. Function
    - function has scope: variables in functional cannot be called globally
2. Object, classes
    - individual code entity
	- objects are instances of the classes
	- a class `__init__` to start a object with a set of variables
	- set functions unique to the class
	- subclasses

## objects behaves differently
- inheritance:
    - if you change the upper instance where the instance it is from: it will also be changed
	- if just value: each variable points to the vcalue
	- but when use object we are pointing to the object in memory. We did not create another point, they point to the same thing. So when u modify one thing, both are modifies.
	- how to make a hard copy? use the `copy` method.
	- if object in object use `deep copy` and `shallow copy`

## organize your code
- locality
- modularity

# Package and library
- package, namesapce, function
