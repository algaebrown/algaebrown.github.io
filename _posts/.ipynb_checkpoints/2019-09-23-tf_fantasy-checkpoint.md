If I were a trascription factor, how would I see my DNA? Would I see ATGCTCG? or do I see motifs with colors and sizes hinting me the frequency I should bind? Neither of these I would see, as now I am a transcripion factor. I don't have eyes to "see anything". I can't read either, as I don't have brain, and did not go to school in the past. All I have is my hands made of amino acids and some post-translational modifications like wedding rings. These atoms in it gave me some senses of whether I should bind when I touch the DNA.

# Translocation
I work in the company called nucleus. There's a door, and I need special IDs to pass it. I have my own secretory, and when needed, they carry the ID and bring me to my company. Who decide "when is needed?" Great question. Signalling control.

Working in a nucleus isn't easy. The cell has so many DNAs and proteins, my co-workers, packed inside the company. If these DNAs are unorganized, they might just burst like some disorganized yarn when I open the door of the nucleus. Can you imagine how much trouble I would have? In that case, I will need to touch all the yarns and trying to feel the places I should bind, which will definetely takes a lot of time. Fortunately, although there are a lot of DNAs, not every one of them is available. Our company - the nucleus - are more organized than you think. They have some proteins and RNAs that organize them. Some of them are so tightly packed that I cannot feel them. In that case, I don't bind.

Aside from the proteins that trys to organize the DNAs, our company is actually much more organized than you thought.  For example, they put DNAs containing gene that I shouldn't bind that often into the periphery of the company, that is, the nuclear lamina. Several genes are organized into close to each other so that I can do my work. You might wonder, who is responsible to put all of the, into places? It's a great question. There are a lot of staffs in the nuclues, for example, long-non-coding RNA and tons of chromatin binding proteins. The DNAs are added with stickers hinting my co-workers where to take them. Sometimes I move them a bit, too. In the nucleus things are simple. We all bind and affect each other, organizing genes as a way to regulate them.

When it comes to binding my DNA, which we intially discussed, I want to emphasize again that I don't have eyes. Therefore I don't read ATCG like a computer. For me, DNAs are a strand of sugar with grooves on it. When they are added stickers, these stickers also cause some difference when I touch them. Some of my cousins are capable of recruiting the sticker groups to add or remove stickers. Some need to feel the special stickers as a go signal, and that they recruit the RNA synthesize team to open up DNA, make downstream products. Sometimes these products also involve some of my other cousins - I know it feels weird that we seem to breed in a way different from human. But one of us inducing the other in a looping fashion can trigger the cell functionality to approximate on-and-off phenomenon.

When cells are developing, that is from one stem cell, to various cell types in our body - the neurons, muscle cells, eye cells, skin cells, we play a huge role along with guys in the nucleus. Genes move around to the right location. They change stickers. We therefore bind to differnet sets of them.
