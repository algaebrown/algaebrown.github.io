# Literature summary
1. [Lineage-specific and single-cell chromatin accessibility charts human hematopoiesis and leukemia evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3646#supplementary-information)

- ATAC-seq on human (healthy and diseased, FACs data available)
- Enhancers are lineage specific (region data available), can CIBERSORT deconvolute them
- From these chromatin accessible region --> find motifs --> find key transcription factors: (GATA, RUNX, SPI1, PAX)
- but motifs are highly similar among TFs how do we know which is which?
	- further use RNA-seq (see which TF is present) + ATAC-seq (what motif is available)
	- Some show high correlation but some don't (HOX), they say something like "complex acessibility" which I don't understand. Maybe need other proteins to help? need epigenome modifiers?
	
- then they move on to see the variants(from GWAS) in regulatory region and at what stage they are avaiable
- they see the ATAC-seq in leukemoia patient and found higher heterogenity within cell types
    - they found leukemic cells are a mix of cellular states from different normal cell's enhancers

2. [Dynamic interaction networks in a hierarchically organized tissue](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/msb.2010.71)
- found pathways upregulated and downregulated v.s. stem cell expansion
    - a list of activating and repressing cytokines [Table S9-11]
- enrich downstream pathway from a literature curated gene sets about stem cell self renewal [Table S14]
    - gene set --> PPI --> enrich for KEGG and PATHER pathway 
	- find shared pathway molecules in stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines
3. [A 3D Atlas of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell Expansion by Multi-dimensional RNA-Seq Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124719304954)
- single and bulk RNA-seq on developing zebrafish caudal something (resemble fetal liver), as well as GEO-seq
- close crosstalk between HSPC and endothelial cells --> developmental crosstalk
- region specific signalling pathway (Table S2) as well as ligand-receptor pair based on GEO-seq(Table S3)
- cross talk between ligand receptor pair between different tissue (neural, muscle, blood vessel)
- cell cycle features correlate with lineage??

- a list of FACs markers Table S2
- a list of lineage specific genes Table S5
- a list of lineage specific genes that are enriched in specific perturbations Table S6
- lineage specific genes that are also max in human Table S7

- definition of progenitor and stem cells are different
    - definition of HSC stem cell state = self renewal and multiplotency
    - HSC is defined by more than transcriptional regulation
        - HSC: quiscent, autophagy dependent, glycolytic, low mitochondrial content
        - progenitor: highly proliferative, metabolic active
    - HSC heterogeneity in self renewal: after transplant, will HSC become more HSC, or become multiple lineages
        - long term HSC: after transplant, HSC populated the marrow
            - this kinda cell are usually dormant, take long time to exit quiscent, high vitA metabolism/p57, low protein and Myc
            - label retaining assay to see their division history, in order to seperate these kinds of cell.
        - intermediate/short term HSC/multipotent progenitor: after transplant, becomes multiple lineage --> low self renewal
    - HSC output: what cell will they eventually become?
        - At what stage does lineage decision occur
        - key points in cell fate decision
            - combinations of transcription factor(TF) - promoter/enhancer/silencer region --> transcription of certain genes
            - transcription factor also recruits epigenetic modifier - modification of histone and DNA --> stays for a few generation **epigenetic memory**
            - relationship between TF proposed:
                - cross antagonism
                - positive autoregulation: momentum
                - feed forward loop: upstream regulates both direct target and intermediate regulator, filter transient signal
            - stochastic v.s. intrusive (low level cytokine receptor)
     - is haematopoiesis a continuum or distinct process?
         - while scRNA-seq supports continuum, combinations of surface marker can seperate cells into distinct population
             - steady state mRNA != protein abundance
             - epigenetic is the key
             - **biological function** instead of surface marker is important
             - scRNA-seq is unable to distinguish between cell types?
                 - what is the definition of cell type?? based on transplantation output and functional assay??
- new view of haematopoiesis:
    - tree model is outdated
        - each predifined population of cells is "heterogeneous"
        - transition from one state to another has more than one possibility
   - see figure [2a and 2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25022/figures/2)
        - lineage snapshots
        - one HSC becomes multiple progenitor --> division history tracing - `lineage tracing in single cell` using mito DNA
   - these tree like structure are derived from "transplantation assay", which are purturbed haematopoiesis, not steady state haematopoiesis
        - in steady state haematopoiesis MPP derived to myeloids instead of the dormant HSCs
            - experiments by barcoding stem cells
   - difference between adult and fetal haematopoiesis
       - different cell cycle property, proliferative potential
       - different bias in output
       - different telomere length
