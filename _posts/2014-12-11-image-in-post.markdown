1. germinal v.s. somatic mutation
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21894/
germinline mutation is also related to cancer development

2. ATCG genetic
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21893844

3. in levels
- DNA: mutation, copy number
- RNA edition, alternative splicing
- protein: alternative v.s. protein
- signal transduction

4. neoplasia = uncontrolled growth
5. driver v.s. passenger
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340638

6. TCGA: genome, methyl, RNA of;
 IGCG
 
 7. mutation profile
 8. de-differentiation
 - by epigenentic modification 
 
 - immunotherapy: immunogenomics
 - micorenvinorment: 

9. Prognosis:
- survival
   - overall: % of patient are alive
   - relative: % of alive / % alive in similar population --> other cause of death is corrected from the general population
   - cancer specific survival: % patient die from cancer
   - disease free survival: % patient live without signs/symptoms of cancer
       - recurrence-free survival
       - progression-free survival
- stage: TNM system and stage I-IV
- grade: histological appearance: well-differentiate? undifferentiated?


10. Heritability of cancer?
- germline mutation also take part of cancer development

11. Herterogeiety of cancer

12. Proto-oncogene/oncogene v.s. tumor supressor gene
- increased expression: copy-number, promoter, or regulation problem, chromosome rearrangement

** which hallmark of cancer does that lead to (oncogene)
** copy number of tumor supressor gene

- SNP, indel
- inversion, translocation
- chr number (gene amplification


point mutation rate stays the same in cancer??
