Unsolved. Keep saying something like 

End up using conda's R (which I hate so much) and so far it worked fine.

# installing R package that is not in conda, but on github.
Avoid `devtool` `install_github` cause dependencies installed will not be recognized by conda.


Instead
```
conda skeleton cran
```

and then 
```
conda build <recipe directory>
```

[ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52061664/install-r-package-from-github-using-conda)

I was installing [Liger](https://macoskolab.github.io/liger/), a package to integrate single cell data from various origin.

when I do `conda build` it ends up with `MemoryError`.

So I allocated more memory by `qlogin -l h_vmem=14G`.

Wasn't sure why it need so much memory to install.

Then I upload it to anaconda cloud by

`anaconda upload /cellar/users/hsher/conda-bld/linux-64/r-liger-1.0-r351h29659fb_0.tar.bz`

it might be easier to work with it later lol.
