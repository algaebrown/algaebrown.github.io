# About me

I am currently a PhD student in UCSD bioinformatics and systems biology(BISB) program. I am part of the Yeo lab where I decode post-transcriptional regulation with computational methods. My research surrounds RNA-binding proteins(RBP) and sequencing technology development. In particular, I collaborate with wet lab scientist to improve CLIP and STAMP protocols for various purposes. I write softwares and create statistical models for dataset of interest. My previous work in Yu-Wei Wu lab surrounds antibiotic resistance and pan-genome. Here you can find a list of my ["scientific publicaton"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EQIcQpoAAAAJ&hl=enE).

I love patterns. That is why disentagling patterns in sequencing data gives me a high. Besides science, I like patterns in color, shapes and lines. Generally, anything visual attracts me. I draw and design randoms stuffs. Here are my ["recent creative action potential"](https://www.instagram.com/insilicocell/) and some [older collections/portfolio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12F5BlatxtLVkYQ48Kqy66fKiQwjRxkV47duFvHTSVqQ/edit?usp=sharing). I wish I had a better artistic portfolio. But let me sort out my candidacy exam first.
