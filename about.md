	<p class="intro">Hsuan-Lin is a Medical Student from Taiwan, who is interested in explaining the concept of disease with molecules and sequences. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> Theme. It can be used as is or customized to your hearts desire.</p>
	<p class = "intro"> My interest of the microscopic view of life science started early. When I was in high school, chemistry and physics were my favorite subjects, because I just love the way those scientist view the world. Their world is constructed with simple rules, such as atoms, forces. The idea of atoms making up all the things around me is fascinating. How can that be possible that such a small and simple particle create living creatures and bodies that are so perfectly regulated?
    In particular, I am interested in the dysregulated body - diseases. Because, my gradma lost her eyesight in her mid-thirties, and till now, none of us, nor the doctors know exactly what happened. Is it possible to find a simple rule like atoms, to explain what had gone through my grandma's body. As a result, I chose to go to medical school, the only major that will have a board knowledge about the disease and the human body. However, I was not satisfied by the current theories. In fact, most of the time in medical school, we learn how to deliver the "optimal" management - which is not always satisfying - and does not have much time to think at a lower level. We spend a lot of time memorising existing theories - lots of signalling pathways, available drugs, side effects...etc, and try to integrate them in our small human brain. The huge amount of information often fail to predict the results or even give an explanation of the phenomonon. Therefore, aimed at finding out the underlying rules and provide a more holostic view of diseases, I started to participate in researches labs.
    During my second year, I took biochemistry, cell biology and programming courses at the same time, due to the need of the research projects. Again, a lot of details flooded into my brain. I LOVE to know those pathways and protein structures, but I HATE to memorise them. It's impossible for a person to have a holisitic view of a cell. All that we can do is focus on a protein, or one pathway, at the DNA or RNA level...etc. But in the real cells, so many kinds of molecules float and interact, obeying the rules of chemistry. How would it be like to take a tour into the cell, and just observe what really happen. The programming course sparked my idea of an in silico cell. Computers can store a lot of information. They can as well, calculate a huge amount of data. Maybe it will be a good idea to let computers do the job, and let it tell me what will and had happened at the microscopic level.
    As a result, I started my journey in bioinformatics. Working with sequences and molecules, I feel as if I were building a cell in the server. From the genomic level, we find all possible genes that can be acquired by a bateria, and then use that to predict the outcome - antibiotic resistance. Then we moved on to find the relations between genes - how they may interact - by digging the information retained in evolution, expression pattern and retrieve the known from literature. At first, working with servers - a mouse-free environment - was very challenging for me. Those mathematical representations of sequences and machine learning models are puzzling as well. However, with the aid of several friends, advisor and serials of online tutorials, I gradually get used to work and think as a computer scientist. </p>
