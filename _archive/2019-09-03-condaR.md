# Types of Regulation in a Cell

The central dogma states: DNA is transcribed into RNA, RNA is translated into protein, and protein is the functional element of the cell. However, not all the genes in DNA are transcribed to RNAs. Not all RNAs produce protein. What decides this control process in termed "regulation". The mechanisms that decide which DNA to transcribe is call "transcriptional regulation"; and the events that happen transcription - Which RNA should produce protein, while others should be degraded - is termed "post-transcriptional regulation".

Why are regulations important? In your body, there are so many different types of cells - brain cells, bone cells, skin cells ...etc. All of them have the same DNA material, but they can do very different things. The brain cell can direct electric activity along its body while the skin cells can't. The stomach cells can secrete acid to help digest food, while the bones don't do that. What contribute to these differences? Regulation.
