There was always a question in my mind: What makes a cell **become** the another kind of cell?

All cells within our body has the same genome. They have the same set of genes. So, what makes them different? Textbooks tells us, it is the **gene expression** that makes the cells different. So what controls **gene expression**, that makes a cell becomes another? What makes a stem cell becomes, say, cardiomyocytes? And why, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclersis) mutations primarily affects neurological system, but not other organs?

Can we gain control of the **gene expression switches**, so as to generate new cells, and to repair the diseased organ?

Disclaimer: this is not an review article. I am just so happy after reading a few articles, that are seemlying unrelated (to me in the past), and feel that I see some future towards my question. :)
